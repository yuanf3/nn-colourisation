nn-colourisation

# What is this?
This project is an attempt to colourise line illustrations using a convolutional
neural network (CNN). It consists of a bunch of Python 3 scripts set out in a
Jupyter notebook file.

# How do I run it?
You probably don't want to, as it takes a while!

1. Go to the [Kaggle
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/tagged-anime-illustrations)
2. Press *New NoteBook*
3. Upload `project.ipynb`
4. Run the notebook

Note: This was originally developed locally using the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) python distribution, 
not the online platform provided by Kaggle.
